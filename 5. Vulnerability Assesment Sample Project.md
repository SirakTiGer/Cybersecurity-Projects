## Approach
The assessment considered the **data storage and management methods** of the business. Likelihood and impact of potential threats were evaluated against the risks posed to operational needs.

---

## Remediation Strategy
To mitigate identified risks, the following measures are recommended:
1. **Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing:**
   - Use strong passwords and **role-based access controls**.
   - Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to limit user privileges.
2. **Data Encryption:**
   - Transition from SSL to **TLS** for secure data in motion.
3. **IP Allow-Listing:**
   - Restrict access to corporate offices to block unauthorized users from connecting to the database.
4. **Regular Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuous audits to track system access and detect anomalies.
