## Project description
This project is a Python algorithm that controls access to restricted files of a healthcare company. The intended objective is achieved by importing a file and filtering out unauthorized

## Open the file that contains the allow list
To open a file we first need to assign a string containing the file name to a variable called import_file. Then we run the open () function with two arguments, the variable and an access permission level.
