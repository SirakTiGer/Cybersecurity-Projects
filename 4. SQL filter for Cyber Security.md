# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## Project Description

As a Security Analyst, it is my responsibility to investigate security incidents and mitigate potential risks. To execute my role effectively, I use SQL commands to filter, retrieve, and analyze data, securing my organization's systems. Below are examples of SQL commands I use to perform my security-related tasks.

## Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts

In a recent security incident investigation, I found that the incident occurred after working hours (after 6 PM). To identify all failed login attempts, I ran the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 0;
```

The query retrieves all failed login attempts after 6 PM. I retrieved 19 failed login attempts. The AND logical operator combines two conditions: login time after 18:00 and login success set to 0 (failed).

## Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates

There was a security incident on two specific dates. To investigate, I ran the following SQL query to retrieve all login attempts on those dates:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-08' OR login_date = '2022-05-09';
```
This command retrieves records from the log_in_attempts table that match either of the specified dates. The OR operator ensures records meeting either condition are included. As a result, I retrieved 75 records of login attempts on these dates.

## Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico
Noticing suspicious login attempts from outside Mexico, I investigated using the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'Mexico%';
```
The query retrieves records from the log_in_attempts table for login attempts outside of Mexico. The NOT operator excludes the specified condition, while the LIKE operator and % wildcard handle variations in country names.

## Retrieve Employees in Marketing
To install security software in the marketing department, I needed to identify offices belonging to the department. I used this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'M%';
```
This query retrieves all records from the employees table where the department is Marketing and office designations start with M.

Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales
For security software updates in the Finance and Sales departments, I ran the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```
The OR operator retrieves employees from either the Finance or Sales departments.

## Retrieve All Employees Not in IT
To perform security updates on employees not in the IT department, I used the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE NOT department = 'IT';
```
This query filters for employees not in the Information Technology department using the NOT operator.

## Summary
In this project, I demonstrated the use of SQL queries and commands for security operations. I utilized two tables to filter relevant records and enhanced the filtering using operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, along with the LIKE operator and % wildcard. These commands helped me identify and mitigate security risks effectively.
