## Project description
This project is a Python algorithm that controls access to restricted files of a healthcare company. The intended objective is achieved by importing a file and filtering out unauthorized

## Open the file that contains the allow list
To open a file we first need to assign a string containing the file name to a variable called import_file. Then we run the open () function with two arguments, the variable and an access permission level.

The ‘with’ before the open() function is a python keyword that handles the opening and closing files, errors and external resources.
The ‘r’ parameter inside the open () function is the ‘read’ file permission. There is a ‘w’ file permission also to represent ‘write’ permission.
The open() function opens the file and assigns it to the ‘file’ variable. This function has two parameters, the name of the file and the permission(“r” for read ,”w” for write and “a” for append)
The ‘file’ variable is where we store the file we just imported. It is used to run codes inside the with statement

## Read the file contents
To read the file we opened fun the read() function of the ‘file’ variable inside the with statement and assign to the variable called ip_addresses to make it easier to manipulate the content of the file.

## Convert the string into a list
Normaly a file imported and opened has its content in the form of a string. To be able to apply different filtering rules and conditions we need to convert the string in to a list.

split() function of the variable is used to convert the string into a list and store it back to the variable itself.  Split() takes in a string and stores its content into a list. Each element of the list is extracted based on a split point. By default if the function does not have any parameters it splits based on white space or a line break.

## Iterate through the remove list
To iterate thought the list use the ‘for’ loop with ‘element’ variable to represent each element in the list called ip_addresses.

## Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
The provided  ‘remove_list’ is a list containing a list of ip addresses that needs to be removed from access to the file. To remove the ip addresses in the ‘remove_list’ from the approved  ‘ip_addresses” list, we have to iterate through the list matching each element of the remove_list to ip_addreses. And we need to run a conditional statement in the for loop to specify an action,i.e remove, if the condition is met.

## Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses 
After the unwanted IP addresses are removed from the list of approved ip addresses, the final task is to rewrite the original file with the updated data. To be able to achieve that objective, the first step is to convert the list called ‘ip_addresses’ into a string.
.join() is a function that merges the content of a list in to a string.  
“\n” string in our code is a parameter for the join() function, which tells it to join each element of the list into a string with a separate line.
Next, open the file again with ‘w’ , write permission’ and write the updated data into the original file.
file.write() is a function on file variables that writes the content of the given string into a file. If the file has a content, it will be replaced by the new string.

## Summary
In this project I was able to utilize python's functions to be able to control access to restricted files based on the list of IP addresses of employees' computers . The algorithm opened a provided list of ip addresses in a file format, split the string type content of the file into a list, removed the unauthorized ip addresses from the list, converted the list back into string format and wrote the newly updated data back to the original file.
