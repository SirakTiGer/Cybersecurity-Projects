# Incident Report Analysis

## Introduction  
This project demonstrates an analysis of an incident report using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The incident involved a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on an organization's network, and the analysis is broken down according to the NIST Incident Response Cycle.

---

## Summary  
The organization experienced a DoS attack, resulting in a complete loss of network access for approximately two hours. During this time, normal traffic was unable to access network resources, causing significant disruption to operations.

## Incident Analysis Using the NIST Framework  

| **Phase**   | **Details**                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identify** | The incident management team discovered that the organization's network services were flooded with a high volume of ICMP packets, causing a total shutdown of network services. They responded by: <ul><li>Blocking all incoming ICMP packets.</li><li>Stopping all non-critical network services.</li><li>Restoring critical network services.</li></ul> |
| **Protect**  | The cybersecurity team identified that an unconfigured firewall allowed a malicious actor to execute an ICMP-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. They mitigated this vulnerability by: <ul><li>Configuring firewall rules to limit the rate of ICMP packets.</li><li>Enabling source IP address verification to identify spoofed IPs.</li></ul> |
| **Detect**   | To prevent similar incidents in the future, the team implemented a network monitoring system to detect abnormal traffic patterns and identify potential threats early. |
| **Respond**  | The cybersecurity team deployed an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to filter ICMP traffic based on specific characteristics. They also informed upper management about the incident and the mitigation measures. |
| **Recover**  | All critical and non-critical network services were successfully restored, ensuring normal operations resumed promptly. |

## Conclusion  
This analysis highlights the importance of proactive measures like firewall configuration, network monitoring, and incident response planning in safeguarding an organization's network from DoS and DDoS attacks. By following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the organization effectively managed the incident and implemented measures to prevent recurrence.
